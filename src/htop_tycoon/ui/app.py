"""htop_tycoon.ui.app — HtopTycoonApp: Textual App skeleton + locked 5-region layout.

Locks the contract from ``.omo/plans/htop-tycoon.md`` line 434-456 (T16):

- ``HtopTycoonApp`` subclasses ``textual.app.App`` and accepts
  ``seed: int = 42``, ``tick_rate: float = 1.0``, ``no_autosave: bool = False``.
- ``BINDINGS = []`` is a class attribute (filled in T24-T25).
- CSS lives in ``app.tcss`` (sibling of this module) and defines the locked
  5-region layout: header / metrics / body (org-tree + employee-panel) /
  alerts / footer.
- ``on_mount`` starts the periodic tick via ``self.set_interval`` using the
  locked wrapper ``self._tick_once`` — see the wiring note in
  ``_tick_once``'s docstring (do NOT call ``engine.advance`` directly).
- ``_tick_once`` is the CRITICAL wiring: a no-arg wrapper that supplies the
  current ``self.state`` to ``engine.advance``. Textual's ``set_interval``
  passes no arguments, but ``engine.advance(state, n_ticks)`` requires the
  state, so the wrapper is the only correct pattern.

This module is the UI entry point. UI handlers MUST NOT mutate ``self.state``
directly — the engine is the only writer (per AGENTS.md "State boundary"
invariant). The wrapper here delegates to ``engine.advance`` and rebinds
``self.state`` to the returned new state, then publishes events via the bus.
